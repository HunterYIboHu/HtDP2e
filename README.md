# Order for Conducting Study Sessions

In preparation for a study session, members will (ideally) work through the [HtDP2e](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/) examples and exercises on their own, i.e. in the [DrRacket](http://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/) environment running on their personal computers. They should save their work and plan to share it at the upcoming session. It would be great, too, if participants go beyond the examples and exercises, writing little programs motivated by what they've learned since the previous session.

It would be a good idea to include comments in the source code, indicating points to be explored with the group: inspirations, insights, surprises, questions, difficulties, and so on. It's perfectly fine to share code that doesn't work. Members who know how to use [git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) and [GitHub](https://github.com/stl-racket) are welcome to submit [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to STL Racket's [HtDP2e](https://github.com/stl-racket/HtDP2e) GitHub repository â€“ *source code should be organized in subdirectories bearing the authors' initials*. Code can also be shared via Dropbox at the beginning of a study session.

Members and newcomers who did not have time to work through the material are still very welcome to attend the session. Their participation may end up being a bit more passive, but it should still be a good learning experience. Also, there is no strict requirement for sharing one's source code with the group.

At the start of each session, the moderator will ask who has code to share, to get an idea of which members will be wanting to take turns "driving" the shared Racket laptop hooked to the big-screen TV in the meeting room. The shared laptop will be synced with the GitHub repo, and anyone who wishes to share code via Dropbox can do so at that time.

The moderator will then lead the group through the selected sections in the HtDP2e book, asking those with code (and/or questions, difficulties, etc.) to speak up and take their turns on the shared laptop. By the end of the session (approx. 90 minutes), the group will hopefully have reviewed all of the current material, and all participants will have had an opportunity to share their stuff. It will be the moderator's responsibility to keep things moving along at a brisk but enjoyable pace.

If time is left over, the group can take on an impromptu coding challenge, or explore in more detail some points already covered.

Finally, the session will wrap up with a quick roundtable to decide how much HtDP2e material we want to cover in the next session.
