# Order for Conducting Study Sessions

In preparation for a study session, members will ideally work through the examples and exercises in the [HtDP2e](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/) sections selected for the upcoming session, as announced on the session's meetup.com event-page.

Members who know how to use [git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) and [GitHub](https://github.com/stl-racket) are welcome to submit [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to STL Racket's [HtDP2e GitHub repository](https://github.com/stl-racket/HtDP2e) &mdash; source code for solutions to exercises, etc. should be organized in subdirectories bearing the authors' initials. Code can also be shared via Dropbox at the beginning of a study session.

Members and newcomers who did not have time to work through the material are still very welcome to attend. However, it is highly encouraged that all participants do so as the concepts covered in the current sections will receive special focus during our time together.

At the start of each session, the moderator (probably me most of the time, but other members are welcome to fill that role) will open a brief roundtable discussion to address any questions or difficulties encountered during our individual studies. The shared laptop will be synced with the GitHub repo, and anyone who wishes to share code via Dropbox can do so at that time.

The group will then begin working collaboratively on some project determined in advance of the meeting, as announced on the session's event-page. Participants are encouraged to attempt the project on their own (in whole or part) leading up to the session. Experience and insights gained in the process can then be shared with the group as we work hard to complete our project during the course of the meeting (which should last approx. 90 minutes).

Finally, the session will wrap up with another brief roundtable discussion to decide how much material we want to cover in the next session and to air ideas for our next group project.
